# Local example

Applies circuit-rust to a throwaway Rocky Linux 10 container with systemd, installing Rust 1.99.1. You need Conn3x and Podman.

```sh
./up.sh
conn3x init
conn3x apply
conn3x plan
```

The second plan says `No changes.` To see it working:

```sh
ssh -p 2331 -i id_ed25519 -o UserKnownHostsFile=known_hosts root@127.0.0.1 'rustc --version; cargo --version'
```

`up.sh` listens on `127.0.0.1:2331`. Set `PORT` to use another port, and pass the same port to Conn3x with `-var port=PORT`. Set `CONTAINERFILE` to test another distro, such as one of the images in Conn3x's `test/images`, which CI uses.

`./down.sh` stops the container, which removes it, and deletes the key and the state.
